The original icons for the classical elements were made by [Joshua Clayton](https://github.com/jclayton/classical-elements).

I took the classical representation of earth to derive an icon for wood and for metal. The wood symbol has a horizontal bar above the original horizontal line on the earth icon to represent the wood that grows above the earth. The metal symbol has a horizontal bar below the original horizontal line on the earth icon to represent the metal found within the earth. I interpreted wood and metal as materials derived from the earth and to represent that, I drew the metal and wood symbols with the earth symbol as its base.
